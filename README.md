This example demonstrates a common error in Dapps involving the incorrect handling of asynchronous operations.  The `getBalance` function uses `web3.eth.getBalance`, which is an asynchronous operation. However, the code attempts to log the result of `getBalance` directly.  This results in logging the promise object rather than the actual balance. The solution shows how to correctly handle the asynchronous operation using `async/await`.
